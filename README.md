# MapSploit

Network Vulnerability Scanner

## Description

MapSploit is a bash script for a network vulnerability scanning. MapSploit checks if Metasploit and Nmap are installed on your system, installs them if they're not, and then uses them to scan a target network for vulnerabilities.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/CorvusCodex/MapSploit.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
    ```bash
    cd MapSploit
    ```
3. Make the script executable:
    ```bash
    chmod +x mapsploit.sh
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script as root and pass the target network as a command-line argument:
    ```bash
    sudo ./scanner.sh <target-network> # 192.168.0.1
    ```
2. Follow the prompts in the terminal to install any necessary packages.
3. The results of the scan will be saved to `report.txt` in the same directory.
